# Football Market Evaluation
## Authors: Zevin Attisha, Santi Guerrero, Santiago Pedetti, Christian Vaikona

This is our **Final Project** for our **Data Science Foundations and Programming (COMP352)** class taught by **Professor Daniel Matlock**

In our Football Market Evaluation project, we will be analyzing Football (Soccer) player-market data that we retrieved from Kaggle, sourced by Transfer Markt. This database contains items such as game_id, club_id, and player_id, and many more, which we will use to evaluate players to determine their market value, and, furthermore, predict their future market value in the case of player transfers, acquisitions, and similar procedures.
